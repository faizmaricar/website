description: My journey into software development
---
I never set out to get into a career building software but here I am building websites and apps for a living. Although I never planned to work with computers, I always did have a fascination with them. Maybe it was because growing up there was always a computer. I was lucky that way. I grew up in the 90s, playing computer games and experiencing the early days of the internet but it wasn't until I was 16 that I started coding.

At that time I was attending school which required every student to have a laptop. It was a novel idea at the time. One of the modules I had to take was a basic computing course and I was introduced to Visual Basic, a language developed by Microsoft. I remember not caring much for the what I learnt event though I did get a good grade for it. I was always more interested in the life sciences which eventually led me to pursue a degree in Biomedical Sciences. It was there where my interest in coding piqued. I could not explain it but I felt I was under utilising this beautiful machine I had on top of my desk.

I started learning the python programming language which I must admit was easy to learn. It had a simple syntax and it was easy to write scripts. If I had to learn coding all over again, I would still think to start with learning python. I started getting curious about web development and building mobile applications.

After graduating, I did manage to secure employment as a lab assistant at a clinical trial facility. What I really wanted to do was research and I applied to various research assistant positions. I went on numerous interviews but never got offered a job. I thought of going back to further my studies but that never really appealed to me. 

Being disillusioned with my career prospects, I decided to see if I could get into tech. Fortunately for me, there was sort of attach and train programme where I could get a job with a company that needed a position filled and the government would subsidise my training. This is where I got my first job as an associate software developer and the rest as they say is history.

Here I am now and it has been five years and I am happy as I can be building applications. If there is anything to be learned about my story is that you can always pick up anything if you put your mind to it and you will never know where life takes you.
